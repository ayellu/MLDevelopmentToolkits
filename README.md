# MLDevelopmentToolkits

This repository contains python files(.py/.ipynb files) for the four different configurations of dataset/model and toolkits. 

Usage:
Weights and Biases :
Create a free account on Weights&Biases and get access to the API token of the account.

1. Text Dataset(IMDB reviews) with Keras library
Open the file wandb_monitor_textdata.ipynb from Colab Notebooks folder. Use Google Colab to run the file. Give the API token to log the data. Once the run is complete, open the Weights and Biases dashboard to see the logged data.

2. Image Dataset(MNIST) with fast.ai
Open the file Weights_&_Biases_with_fastai.ipynb from the Colab Notebooks folder. Use Google Colab to run the file. Give the API token to log the data. A new run is created.Once the run is complete, open the Weights and Biases dashboard to see the logged data.

Neptune.ai :
Create a free account on Neptune.ai and create a new project. Replace the project id and api token in your .ipynb files with the new id and token.
1. Text Dataset(IMDB reviews) with Keras library
Open the file NeptuneaiIntegrationWithKeras.ipynb from Colab Notebooks folder. Use Google Colab to run the file.Once the run is complete, open the Neptune.ai dashboard to see the logged data.

2. Image Dataset(MNIST) with fast.ai
Open the file Neptune_fastai.ipynb from the Colab Notebooks folder. Use Google Colab to run the file. A new run is created.Once the run is complete, open the dashboard to see the logged data.
